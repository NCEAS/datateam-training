# Beyond your first ticket

This section is meant to be read after you have processed a couple of tickets and you are comfortable with the workflow with a relatively simple dataset with 1-2 files and want to expand your skills and workflows further.

## Working with large data packages

```{r, child = '../workflows/adc_web_submissions/add_physicals_to_submissions.Rmd'}
```

```{r, child = '../workflows/edit_eml/use_references.Rmd'}
```

## Streamlining your workflow

```{r, child = '../workflows/miscellaneous/code_snippets.Rmd'}
```

```{r, child = '../workflows/miscellaneous/resources_for_r.Rmd'}
```
