Remote files vs. local files If you’re working on the datateam server (RStudio in an internet browser), you’re usually working in the home directory under your username. File paths generally follow this pattern: /home/dmullen/folder/file. Note: These files are not stored on your local machine, they are on a remote server. You can access them through remote SFTP software like Cyberduck. If you’re working with your local RStudio app then your file paths generally follow this pattern: /Users/datateam/folder/file. These files are stored on your local machine and you can access them with Finder. File path shortcuts Using . in a file path refers to your current working directory. You can print your working directory with the call: getwd(). If we assume that my current working directory is home/dmullen, then the following two calls are equivalent: file.exists(&#39;/home/dmullen/myFile.R&#39;) file.exists(&#39;./myFile.R&#39;) Using ~ in a file path does not always refer to your current working directory. This is a common misconception. It is actually set to the global R USER path. You can print this with the call: Sys.getenv('USER'). Let’s assume that I’m working on the arcticdatautils package which I open using a .RProj file. This will update my current working directory to: /home/dmullen/arcticdatautils. Now the following calls are equivalent: file.exists(&#39;/home/dmullen/arcticdatautils/myFile.R&#39;) file.exists(&#39;~/arcticdatautils/myFile.R&#39;) file.exists(&#39;./myFile.R&#39;) "],["metacat-version.html", "Metacat version", " Metacat version Check which version of metacat is currently deployed to - arcticdata.io here, - and to test.arcticdata.io here.

For example, to change the fileName use the following command: sysmeta@fileName &lt;- &#39;NewFileName.csv&#39; Note that some slots cannot be changed by simple text replace (particularly the accessPolicy). There are various helper functions for changing the accessPolicy and rightsHolder such as datapack::addAccessRule() (which takes the sysmeta as an input) or arcticdatautils::set_rights_and_access(), which only requires a PID. In general, you most frequently need to use dataone::getSystemMetadata() to change either the formatId or fileName slots (see the DataONE list of format ids) for acceptable formats. # Example of setting the formatId slot sysmeta@formatId &lt;- &quot;eml://ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.1.1&quot; After you have changed the necessary slot, you can update the system metadata using the following command: updateSystemMetadata(mn, pid, sysmeta) Identifiers and sysmeta Importantly, changing the system metadata does NOT necessitate a change in the PID of an object. This is because changes to the system metadata do not change the object itself, they are only changing the description of the object (although ideally the system metadata are accurate when an object is first published).

The network tree looks something like this: At the top level is DataONE itself. Within DataONE there are several coordinating nodes, including nodes for both production material and testing material. Within these coordinating nodes are many member nodes, including ones for both the Arctic Data Center and the KNB. To set the environment in which you want to publish data, you need to set both the coordinating node and the member node. For example, if you are publishing to the Arctic Data Center test site, you would want to set the coordinating node to STAGING and the member node to mnTestArctic. A note on nodes - be very careful about what you publish on production nodes (PROD, or arcticdata.io). These nodes should NEVER be used to publish test or training data sets.

The function arcticdatautils::set_rights_and_access() will set both, and arcticdatautils::set_access() will just set access. There are two functions for this because a rightsHolder should always have access, but not all people who need access are rightsHolders. The rightsHolder of the data package is typically the submitter (if the data set is submitted through the web form (“editor”)), but if a data team member is publishing objects for a PI, the rightsHolder should be the main point of contact for the data set (i.e. the person who requested that we upload the data for them). To set the rights and access for all of the objects in a package, first get the ORCiD of the person to whom you are giving rights and access. You can set this manually, or grab it from one of the creators in an EML file. You can look up ORCID iDs here # Manually set ORCiD subject &lt;- &#39;http://orcid.org/PUT-YOUR-ORCD-HERE&#39; # Set ORCiD from EML creator # if only 1 creator exists subject &lt;- doc$dataset$creator$userId$userId # if more than 1 creator exists and you want the first one subject &lt;- doc$dataset$creator[[1]]$userId$userId # As a convention we use `http:` instead of `https:` in our system metadata subject &lt;- sub(&quot;^https://&quot;, &quot;http://&quot;, subject) Note, when setting metadata, the ORCiD must start with http://. ORCiDs in EML should start with https://. The sub() command above will change this formatting for you. Next, set the rights and access using the following command: set_rights_and_access(mn, pids = c(pkg$metadata, pkg$data, pkg$resource_map), subject = subject, permissions = c(&#39;read&#39;,&#39;write&#39;,&#39;changePermission&#39;)) If you ever need to remove/add public access to your package or object, you can use remove_public_read() or set_public_read(), respectively. remove_public_read(mn, c(pkg$metadata, pkg$data, pkg$resource_map)) My profile The datasets that render under a user’s profile page like here are added if one of the following three System Metadata fields exists. The subject is the rightsHolder or the subject has one of either write or changePermission in the accessPolicy. If you ever need to remove a subject from the accessPolicy or update the rightsHolder you can use arcticdatautils::remove_access and arcticdatautils::set_rightsHolder, respectively.

To accomplish the second task, you will need to update the metadata using the EML package. This is covered in Chapter 4.

An EML file is organized in a structure that contains many lists nested within other lists. The function View allows you to get a crude view of an EML file in the viewer. It can be useful for exploring the file. # Need to be in this member node to explore file d1c_test &lt;- dataone::D1Client(&quot;STAGING&quot;, &quot;urn:node:mnTestARCTIC&quot;) doc &lt;- read_eml(getObject(d1c_test@mn, &quot;urn:uuid:558eabf1-1e91-4881-8ba3-ef8684d8f6a1&quot;)) View(doc) The complex EML document is represented in R as as series of named, nested lists. We use lists all the time in R! A data.frame is one example of a special kind of list that we use all the time. You may be familiar with the syntax dataframe$column_name which allows us to select a particular column of a data.frame. Under the hood, a data.frame is a named list of vectors with the same length. You select one of those vectors using the $ operator, which is called the “list selector operator.” Just like you navigate in a data.frame, you can use the $ operator to navigate through the EML structure. The $ operator allows you to go deeper into the EML structure and to see what elements are nested within other elements. However, you have to tell R where you want to go in the structure when you use the $ symbol. For example, if you want to view the dataset element of your EML you would use the command doc$dataset. If you want to view the creators of your data set you would use doc$dataset$creator. Note here that creator is contained within dataset. If you aren’t sure where you want to go, hit the tab button on your keyboard after typing $ and a list of available elements in the structure will appear (e.g., doc$&lt;TAB&gt;): Note that if you hit tab, and nothing pops up, this most likely implies that you are trying to go into an EML element that can take a series items. For example doc$dataset$creator$&lt;TAB&gt; will not show a pop-up menu. This is because creator is a series-type object (i.e. you can have multiple creators). If you want to go deeper into creator, you first must tell R which creator you are interested in. Do this by writing [[i]] first where i is the index of the creator you are concerned with. For example, if you want to look at the first creator i = 1. Now doc$dataset$creator[[1]]$&lt;TAB&gt; will give you many more options. Note, an empty autocomplete result sometimes means you have reached the end of a branch in the EML structure. At this point stop and take a deep breath. The key takeaway is that EML is a hierarchical tree structure. The best way to get familiar with it is to explore the structure. Try entering doc$dataset into your console, and print it. Now make the search more specific, for instance: doc$dataset$abstract. "],["understand-the-eml-schema.html", "Understand the EML schema", " Understand the EML schema Another great resource for navigating the EML structure is looking at the schema which defines the structure. The schema diagrams on this page are interactive. Further explanations of the symbology can be found here. The schema is complicated and may take some time to get familiar with before you will be able to fully understand it. For example, let’s take a look at eml-party. To start off, notice that some elements have bolded lines leading to them. A bold line indicates that the element is required if the element above it (to the left in the schema) is used, otherwise the element is optional. Notice also that next to the givenName element it says “0..infinity”. This means that the element is unbounded — a single party can have many given names and there is no limit on how many you can add. However, this text does not appear for the surName element — a party can have only one surname. You will also see icons linking the EML slots together, which indicate the ordering of subsequent slots. These can indicate either a “sequence” or a “choice”. In our example from eml-party, a “choice” icon indicates that either an individualName, organizationName, or positionName is required, but you do not need all three. However, the “sequence” icon tells us that if you use an individualName, you must include the surName as a child element. If you include the optional child elements salutation and givenName, they must be written in the order presented in the schema. The eml schema sections you may find particularly helpful include eml-party, eml-attribute and eml-physical. For a more detailed description of the EML schema, see the reference section on exploring EML. "],["edit-eml.html", "Edit EML ", " Edit EML "],["edit-an-eml-element.html", "Edit an EML element", " Edit an EML element There are multiple ways to edit an EML element. Edit EML with strings The most basic way to edit an EML element would be to navigate to the element and replace it with something else. Easy! For example, to change the title one could use the following command: doc$dataset$title &lt;- &quot;New Title&quot; If the element you are editing allows for multiple values, you can pass it a list of character strings. Since a dataset can have multiple titles, we can do this: doc$dataset$title &lt;- list(&quot;New Title&quot;, &quot;Second New Title&quot;) However, this isn’t always the best method to edit the EML, particularly if the element has sub-elements. Edit EML with the “EML” package To edit a section where you are not 100% sure of the sub-elements, using the eml$elementName() helper functions from the EML package will pre-populate the options for you if you utilize the RStudio autocomplete functionality. The arguments in these functions show the available slots for any given EML element. For example, typing doc$dataset$abstract &lt;- eml$abstract()&lt;TAB&gt; will show you that the abstract element can take either the section or para sub-elements. doc$dataset$abstract &lt;- eml$abstract(para = &quot;A concise but thorough description of the who, what, where, when, why, and how of a dataset.&quot;) This inserts the abstract with a para element in our dataset, which we know from the EML schema is valid. Note that the above is equivalent to the following generic construction: doc$dataset$abstract &lt;- list(para = &quot;A concise but thorough description of the who, what, where, when, why, and how of a dataset.&quot;) The eml() family of functions provides the sub-elements as arguments, which is extremely helpful, but functionally all it is doing is creating a named list, which you can also do using the list function. Edit EML with objects A final way to edit an EML element would be to build a new object to replace the old object. To begin, you might create an object using an eml helper function. Let’s take keywords as an example. Sometimes keyword lists in a metadata record will come from different thesauruses, which you can then add in series (similar to the way we added multiple titles) to the element keywordSet. We start by creating our first set of keywords and saving it to an object. kw_list_1 &lt;- eml$keywordSet(keywordThesaurus = &quot;LTER controlled vocabulary&quot;, keyword = list(&quot;bacteria&quot;, &quot;carnivorous plants&quot;, &quot;genetics&quot;, &quot;thresholds&quot;)) Which returns: $keyword $keyword[[1]] [1] &quot;bacteria&quot; $keyword[[2]] [1] &quot;carnivorous plants&quot; $keyword[[3]] [1] &quot;genetics&quot; $keyword[[4]] [1] &quot;thresholds&quot; $keywordThesaurus [1] &quot;LTER controlled vocabulary&quot; We create the second keyword list similarly: kw_list_2 &lt;- eml$keywordSet(keywordThesaurus = &quot;LTER core area&quot;, keyword = list(&quot;populations&quot;, &quot;inorganic nutrients&quot;, &quot;disturbance&quot;)) Finally, we can insert our two keyword lists into our EML document just like we did with the title example above, but rather than passing character strings into list(), we will pass our two keyword set objects. doc$dataset$keywordSet &lt;- list(kw_list_1, kw_list_2) Note that you must use the function list here and not the c() function. The reasons for this are complex, and due to some technical subtlety in R - but the gist of the issue is that the c() function can behave in unexpected ways with nested lists, and frequently will collapse the nesting into a single level, resulting in invalid EML. "],["edit-attributelists.html", "Edit attributeLists", " Edit attributeLists Attributes are descriptions of variables, typically columns or column names in tabular data. Attributes are stored in an attributeList. When editing attributes in R, you need to create one to three objects: A data.frame of attributes A data.frame of custom units (if applicable) The attributeList is an element within one of 4 different types of entity objects. An entity corresponds to a file, typically. Multiple entities (files) can exist within a dataset. The 4 different entity types are dataTable (most common for us), spatialVector, spatialRaster, and otherEntity Please note that submitting attribute information through the website will store them in an otherEntity object by default. We prefer to store them in a dataTable object for tabular data or a spatialVector object for spatial data. To edit or examine an existing attribute table already in an EML file, you can use the following commands, where i represents the index of the series element you are interested in. Note that if there is only one item in the series (ie there is only one dataTable), you should just call doc$dataset$dataTable, as in this case doc$dataset$dataTable[[1]] will return the first sub-element of the dataTable (the entityName) # If they are stored in an otherEntity (submitted from the website by default) attributeList &lt;- EML::get_attributes(doc$dataset$otherEntity[[i]]$attributeList) # Or if they are stored in a dataTable (usually created by a datateam member) attributeList &lt;- EML::get_attributes(doc$dataset$dataTable[[i]]$attributeList) # Or if they are stored in a spatialVector (usually created by a datateam member) attributeList &lt;- EML::get_attributes(doc$dataset$spatialVector[[i]]$attributeList) attributes &lt;- attributeList$attributes print(attributes) Edit attributes Attribute information should be stored in a data.frame with the following columns: attributeName: The name of the attribute as listed in the csv. Required. e.g.: “c_temp” attributeLabel: A descriptive label that can be used to display the name of an attribute. It is not constrained by system limitations on length or special characters. Optional. e.g.: “Temperature (Celsius)” attributeDefinition: Longer description of the attribute, including the required context for interpreting the attributeName. Required. e.g.: “The near shore water temperature in the upper inter-tidal zone, measured in degrees Celsius.” measurementScale: One of: nominal, ordinal, dateTime, ratio, interval. Required. nominal: unordered categories or text. e.g.: (Male, Female) or (Yukon River, Kuskokwim River) ordinal: ordered categories. e.g.: Low, Medium, High dateTime: date or time values from the Gregorian calendar. e.g.: 01-01-2001 ratio: measurement scale with a meaningful zero point in nature. Ratios are proportional to the measured variable. e.g.: 0 Kelvin represents a complete absence of heat. 200 Kelvin is half as hot as 400 Kelvin. 1.2 meters per second is twice as fast as 0.6 meters per second. interval: values from a scale with equidistant points, where the zero point is arbitrary. This is usually reserved for degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit, or latitude and longitude coordinates, or any other human-constructed scale. e.g.: there is still heat at 0° Celsius; 12° Celsius is NOT half as hot as 24° Celsius. domain: One of: textDomain, enumeratedDomain, numericDomain, dateTime. Required. textDomain: text that is free-form, or matches a pattern enumeratedDomain: text that belongs to a defined list of codes and definitions. e.g.: CASC = Cascade Lake, HEAR = Heart Lake dateTimeDomain: dateTime attributes numericDomain: attributes that are numbers (either ratio or interval) formatString: Required for dateTime, NA otherwise. Format string for dates, e.g. “DD/MM/YYYY”. definition: Required for textDomain, NA otherwise. Definition for attributes that are a character string, matches attribute definition in most cases. unit: Required for numericDomain, NA otherwise. Unit string. If the unit is not a standard unit, a warning will appear when you create the attribute list, saying that it has been forced into a custom unit. Use caution here to make sure the unit really needs to be a custom unit. A list of standard units can be found using: standardUnits &lt;- EML::get_unitList() then running View(standardUnits$units). numberType: Required for numericDomain, NA otherwise. Options are real, natural, whole, and integer. real: positive and negative fractions and integers (…-1,-0.25,0,0.25,1…) natural: non-zero positive integers (1,2,3…) whole: positive integers and zero (0,1,2,3…) integer: positive and negative integers and zero (…-2,-1,0,1,2…) missingValueCode: Code for missing values (e.g.: ‘-999’, ‘NA’, ‘NaN’). NA otherwise. Note that an NA missing value code should be a string, ‘NA’, and numbers should also be strings, ‘-999.’ missingValueCodeExplanation: Explanation for missing values, NA if no missing value code exists. You can create attributes manually by typing them out in R following a workflow similar to the one below: attributes &lt;- data.frame( attributeName = c(&#39;Date&#39;, &#39;Location&#39;, &#39;Region&#39;,&#39;Sample_No&#39;, &#39;Sample_vol&#39;, &#39;Salinity&#39;, &#39;Temperature&#39;, &#39;sampling_comments&#39;), attributeDefinition = c(&#39;Date sample was taken on&#39;, &#39;Location code representing location where sample was taken&#39;,&#39;Region where sample was taken&#39;, &#39;Sample number&#39;, &#39;Sample volume&#39;, &#39;Salinity of sample in PSU&#39;, &#39;Temperature of sample&#39;, &#39;comments about sampling process&#39;), measurementScale = c(&#39;dateTime&#39;, &#39;nominal&#39;,&#39;nominal&#39;, &#39;nominal&#39;, &#39;ratio&#39;, &#39;ratio&#39;, &#39;interval&#39;, &#39;nominal&#39;), domain = c(&#39;dateTimeDomain&#39;, &#39;enumeratedDomain&#39;,&#39;enumeratedDomain&#39;, &#39;textDomain&#39;, &#39;numericDomain&#39;, &#39;numericDomain&#39;, &#39;numericDomain&#39;, &#39;textDomain&#39;), formatString = c(&#39;MM-DD-YYYY&#39;, NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA), definition = c(NA,NA,NA,&#39;Sample number&#39;, NA, NA, NA, &#39;comments about sampling process&#39;), unit = c(NA, NA, NA, NA,&#39;milliliter&#39;, &#39;dimensionless&#39;, &#39;celsius&#39;, NA), numberType = c(NA, NA, NA,NA, &#39;real&#39;, &#39;real&#39;, &#39;real&#39;, NA), missingValueCode = c(NA, NA, NA,NA, NA, NA, NA, &#39;NA&#39;), missingValueCodeExplanation = c(NA, NA, NA,NA, NA, NA, NA, &#39;no sampling comments&#39;)) However, typing this out in R can be a major pain. Luckily, there’s a Shiny app that you can use to build attribute information. You can use the app to build attributes from a data file loaded into R (recommended as the app will auto-fill some fields for you) to edit an existing attribute table, or to create attributes from scratch. Use the following commands to create or modify attributes (these commands will launch a Shiny app in your web browser): #first download the CSV in your data package from Exercise #2 data_pid &lt;- selectMember(dp, name = &quot;sysmeta@fileName&quot;, value = &quot;.csv&quot;) data &lt;- read.csv(text=rawToChar(getObject(d1c_test@mn, data_pid))) # From data (recommended) EML::shiny_attributes(data = data) # From an existing attribute table attributeList &lt;- get_attributes(doc$dataset$dataTable[[i]]$attributeList) EML::shiny_attributes(data = NULL, attributes = attributeList$attributes) # From scratch atts &lt;- EML::shiny_attributes() Once you are done editing a table in the app, quit the app and the tables will be assigned to the atts variable as a list of data frames (one for attributes, factors, and units). Alternatively, each table can be to exported to a csv file by clicking the Download button. If you downloaded the table, read the table back into your R session and assign it to a variable in your script (e.g. attributes &lt;- data.frame(...)), or just use the variable that shiny_attributes returned. For simple attribute corrections, datamgmt::edit_attribute() allows you to edit the slots of a single attribute within an attribute list. To use this function, pass an attribute through datamgmt::edit_attribute() and fill out the parameters you wish to edit/update. An example is provided below where we are changing attributeName, domain, and measurementScale in the first attribute of a dataset. After completing the edits, insert the new version of the attribute back into the EML document. new_attribute &lt;- datamgmt::edit_attribute(doc$dataset$dataTable[[1]]$attributeList$attribute[[1]], attributeName = &#39;date_and_time&#39;, domain = &#39;dateTimeDomain&#39;, measurementScale = &#39;dateTime&#39;) doc$dataset$dataTable[[1]]$attributeList$attribute[[1]] &lt;- new_attribute Edit custom units EML has a set list of units that can be added to an EML file. These can be seen by using the following code: standardUnits &lt;- EML::get_unitList() View(standardUnits$units) Search the units list for your unit before attempting to create a custom unit. You can search part of the unit you can look up part of the unit ie meters in the table to see if there are any matches. If you have units that are not in the standard EML unit list, you will need to build a custom unit list. A unit typically consists of the following fields: id: The unit id (ids are camelCased) unitType: The unitType (run View(standardUnits$unitTypes) to see standard unitTypes) parentSI: The parentSI unit (e.g. for kilometer parentSI = “meter”) multiplierToSI: Multiplier to the parentSI unit (e.g. for kilometer multiplierToSI = 1000) name: Unit abbreviation (e.g. for kilometer name = “km”) description: Text defining the unit (e.g. for kilometer description = “1000 meters”) To manually generate the custom units list, create a dataframe with the fields mentioned above. An example is provided below that can be used as a template: custom_units &lt;- data.frame( id = c(&#39;siemensPerMeter&#39;, &#39;decibar&#39;), unitType = c(&#39;resistivity&#39;, &#39;pressure&#39;), parentSI = c(&#39;ohmMeter&#39;, &#39;pascal&#39;), multiplierToSI = c(&#39;1&#39;,&#39;10000&#39;), abbreviation = c(&#39;S/m&#39;,&#39;decibar&#39;), description = c(&#39;siemens per meter&#39;, &#39;decibar&#39;)) Using EML::get_unit_id for custom units will also generate valid EML unit ids. Custom units are then added to additionalMetadata using the following command: unitlist &lt;- set_unitList(custom_units, as_metadata = TRUE) doc$additionalMetadata &lt;- list(metadata = list(unitList = unitlist)) Edit factors For attributes that are enumeratedDomains, a table is needed with three columns: attributeName, code, and definition. attributeName should be the same as the attributeName within the attribute table and repeated for all codes belonging to a common attribute. code should contain all unique values of the given attributeName that exist within the actual data. definition should contain a plain text definition that describes each code. To build factors by hand, you use the named character vectors and then convert them to a data.frame as shown in the example below. In this example, there are two enumerated domains in the attribute list - “Location” and “Region”. Location &lt;- c(CASC = &#39;Cascade Lake&#39;, CHIK = &#39;Chikumunik Lake&#39;, HEAR = &#39;Heart Lake&#39;, NISH = &#39;Nishlik Lake&#39; ) Region &lt;- c(W_MTN = &#39;West region, locations West of Eagle Mountain&#39;, E_MTN = &#39;East region, locations East of Eagle Mountain&#39;) The definitions are then written into a data.frame using the names of the named character vectors and their definitions. factors &lt;- rbind(data.frame(attributeName = &#39;Location&#39;, code = names(Location), definition = unname(Location)), data.frame(attributeName = &#39;Region&#39;, code = names(Region), definition = unname(Region))) Finalize attributeList Once you have built your attributes, factors, and custom units, you can add them to EML objects. Attributes and factors are combined to form an attributeList using the following command: attributeList &lt;- EML::set_attributes(attributes = attributes, factors = factors) This attributeList must then be added to a dataTable.

How exactly you do this will depend on whether there are dataTable elements in your EML, and how many there are. To replace whatever dataTable elements already exist, you could write: doc$dataset$dataTable &lt;- dataTable If there is only one dataTable in your dataset, the EML package will usually “unpack” these, so that it is not contained within a list of length 1 - this means that to add a second dataTable, you cannot use the syntax doc$dataset$dataTable[[2]], since when unpacked this will contain the entityDescription as opposed to pointing to the second in a series of dataTable elements. Confusing - I know. Not to fear though - this syntax will get you on your way, should you be trying to add a second dataTable. doc$dataset$dataTable &lt;- list(doc$dataset$dataTable, dataTable) If there is more than one dataTable in your dataset, you can return to the more straightforward construction of: doc$dataset$dataTable[[i]] &lt;- dataTable Where i is the index that you wish insert your dataTable into.

Note that both the propertyURI and valueURI have both a label, and the URI itself. doc$dataset$dataTable[[i]]$attributeList$attribute[[i]]$annotation $id [1] &quot;ODBcOyaTsg&quot; $propertyURI $propertyURI$label [1] &quot;contains measurements of type&quot; $propertyURI$propertyURI [1] &quot;http://ecoinformatics.org/oboe/oboe.1.2/oboe-core.owl#containsMeasurementsOfType&quot; $valueURI $valueURI$label [1] &quot;Distributed Biological Observatory region identifier&quot; $valueURI$valueURI [1] &quot;http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002617&quot; Semantic attribute annotations can be applied to spatialRasters, spatialVectors and dataTables How to add an annotation 1. Decide which variable to annotate The goal for the datateam is to start annotating every dataset that comes in. Please make sure to add semantic annotations to spatial and temporal features such as latitude, longitude, site name and date and aim to annotate as many attributes as possible. 2. Find an appropriate valueURI The next step is to find an appropriate value to fill in the blank of the sentence: “this attribute contains measurements of _____.” There are several ontologies to search in. In order of most to least likely to be relevant to the Arctic Data Center they are: The Ecosystem Ontology (ECSO) this was developed at NCEAS, and has many terms that are relevant to ecosystem processes, especially those involving carbon and nutrient cycling The Environment Ontology (EnVO) this is an ontology for the concise, controlled description of environments National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Organismal Classification (NCBITAXON) The NCBI Taxonomy Database is a curated classification and nomenclature for all of the organisms in the public sequence databases. Information Artifact Ontology (IAO) this ontology contains terms related to information entities (eg: journals, articles, datasets, identifiers) To search, navigate through the “classes” until you find an appropriate term. When we are picking terms, it is important that we not just pick a similar term or a term that seems close - we want a term that is totally “right”. For example, if you have an attribute for carbon tetroxide flux and an ontology with a class hierarchy like this: – carbon flux |—- carbon dioxide flux Our exact attribute, carbon tetroxide flux is not listed. In this case, we should pick “carbon flux” as it’s completely correct and not “carbon dioxide flux” because it’s more specific but not quite right. For general attributes (such as ones named depth or length), it is important to be as specific as possible about what is being measured. e.g. selecting the lake area annotation for the area attribute in this dataset 3. Build the annotation in R Manually Annotating this method is great for when you are inserting 1 annotation, fixing an existing annotation or programmatically updating annotations for multiple attributeLists First you need to figure out the index of the attribute you want to annotate. eml_get_simple(doc$dataset$dataTable[[3]]$attributeList, &quot;attributeName&quot;) [1] &quot;prdM&quot; &quot;t090C&quot; &quot;t190C&quot; &quot;c0mS/cm&quot; &quot;c1mS/cm&quot; &quot;sal00&quot; &quot;sal11&quot; &quot;sbeox0V&quot; &quot;flECO-AFL&quot; [10] &quot;CStarTr0&quot; &quot;cpar&quot; &quot;v0&quot; &quot;v4&quot; &quot;v6&quot; &quot;v7&quot; &quot;svCM&quot; &quot;altM&quot; &quot;depSM&quot; [19] &quot;scan&quot; &quot;sbeox0ML/L&quot; &quot;sbeox0dOV/dT&quot; &quot;flag&quot; Next, assign an id to the attribute. It should be unique within the document, and it’s nice if it is human readable and related to the attribute it is describing. One format you could use is entity_x_attribute_y which should be unique in scope, and is nice and descriptive. doc$dataset$dataTable[[3]]$attributeList$attribute[[6]]$id &lt;- &quot;entity_ctd_attribute_salinity&quot; Now, assign the propertyURI information. This will be the same for every annotation you build. doc$dataset$dataTable[[3]]$attributeList$attribute[[6]]$annotation$propertyURI &lt;- list(label = &quot;contains measurements of type&quot;, propertyURI = &quot;http://ecoinformatics.org/oboe/oboe.1.2/oboe-core.owl#containsMeasurementsOfType&quot;) Finally, add the valueURI information from your search. You should see an ID on the Bioportal page that looks like a URL - this is the valueURI. Use the value to populate the label element. doc$dataset$dataTable[[3]]$attributeList$attribute[[6]]$annotation$valueURI &lt;- list(label = &quot;Water Salinity&quot;, valueURI = &quot;http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00001164&quot;) Shiny Attributes this method is great for when you are updating many attributes On the far right of the table of shiny_attributes there are 4 columns: id, propertyURI, propertyLabel, valueURI, valueLabel that can be filled out. Annotating sensitive data Sensitive datasets that might cover protected characteristics (human subjects data, endangered species locations, etc) should be annotated using the data sensitivity ontology: https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/SENSO/?p=classes&amp;conceptid=root. "],["edit-spatial-data.html", "Edit spatial data", " Edit spatial data Occasionally, you may encounter a third type of data object: spatialVector and spatialRaster. These objects contains spatial data (ie maps), such as a shapefile or geodatabase. Editing a spatialVector or spatialRaster is similar to editing a dataTable or an otherEntity. A physical and attributeList should be present. We will focus on how to get the information unique to spatialData and how to create the spatialVector/spatialRaster File types File extensions to look for that might be spatial data: kml, geoJSON, geoTIFF, .dbf, .shp, and .shx Additionally, spatial data that involve multiple files should typically be archived within a .zip file to ensure all related and interdependent files stay together (ie . a geodatabase). This is one of the exceptions to our rule regarding .zip files. For example, a spatial dataset for a shapefile should, at a minimum, consist of separate .dbf, .shp, and .shx files with the same prefix in the same directory. All these files are required in order to use the data. Also note that shapefiles limit attribute names to 10 characters, so attribute names in the metadata may not match exactly to attribute names in the data. Some spatial raster data come as standalone files (.tiff or .nc) and some come as a group of files. If you aren’t sure whether to unzip a file, ask Jasmine or Jeanette. There are specific formatIds for these kinds of zipped files: application/vnd.shp+zip image/geotiff+zip. Remember to check that the files have the correct formatId Reading Spatial Files Read in the files to (1) help you in creating your attributes table and (2) sometimes also figure out the coordinate reference system. library(sf) spatial_file &lt;- sf::read_sf(&quot;example.kml&quot;) When you read kml files, read_sf() sometimes shows additional columns that aren’t in the actual file. Always open kml files in text editor to check if the columns actually exist. If it is a zipped shapefile there is a handy function you can use arcticdatautils::read_zip_shapefile(mn, pid) Coordinate Systems The coordinate system allow to work with spatial data using the same frame of reference (a Datum). A common coordinate system is “GCS_WGS_1984 (used in Google Maps!) which is suitable for plotting points distributed globally. There are many others that may be better suited for certain areas in the world. All latitudes and longitude coordinates should have a coordinate system (like a frame of reference). There are horizontal coordinate systems (earth’s surface) and vertical coordinate systems (depth). More information can be found here. To find the horizCoordSysName you can use: sf::st_crs(spatial_file) Take the Datum and add GCS (Geographic Coordinate System) in front. For example: “GCS_WGS_1984” spatialVector Adding Geometry One important difference is that a spatialVector object should also have a geometry slot that describes the geometry features of the data. The possible values include one or more (in a list) of ‘Point’, ‘LineString’, ‘LinearRing’, ‘Polygon’, ‘MultiPoint’, ‘MultiLineString’, ‘MultiPolygon’, or ‘MultiGeometry’. You will likely have to open the file itself within QGIS or R (ie . the sf package) to get the correct geometry value. To add just a geometry slot use: doc$dataset$spatialVector[[1]]$geometry &lt;- &quot;Polygon&quot; To add it using the data pid: 1. Get the geometry and spatialReference 2. Use pid_to_eml_entity() to generate the spatialVector spatialVector &lt;- pid_to_eml_entity(adc, pkg$data[n], entity_type = &quot;spatialVector&quot;, entityName = &quot;filename.kml&quot;, entityDescription = &quot;some desciption&quot;, attributeList = attributeList, geometry = &quot;Point&quot;, spatialReference = list(horizCoordSysName = &quot;GCS_WGS_1984&quot;)) Add the spatialVector to the doc doc$dataset$spatialVector[[1]] &lt;- spatialVector spatialRasters Most often these come in GeoTiff or Tiff files. The data is presented as a grid of “pixels”. For more information ESRI has a indepth article here. To use the helper function get: the path of your raster file an attribute table a coordinate system To get a coordinate system name, you can use the output of the function on your first try (which will print the coordinate reference system, if it is defined). You can use the return value of get_coord_list() (a large data.frame) to find the correct coordinate system name. Another way to get the coordinate system name is using rgdal::GDALinfo(path). This function can provide many details for your GeoTiff or Tiff files including the coordinate system name. More information can be found here here. rgdal::GDALinfo(path) eml_get_raster_metadata(path, coord_name, attributes) "],["format-text-in-eml.html", "Format text in EML", " Format text in EML Currently, only certain fields (abstracts, methods) support text formatting in EML.

These are useful for maintaining a single identifier when a data package is expected to receive updates (usually additional data) in the future. For example, this dataset has a series id: https://doi.org/10.18739/A2154DQ22 (the doi and urn:uuid are both present at the top of the dataset). Adding a SID to a package Adding a series identifier should be the last step. In most cases the SID will be in DOI format. Once the data package is complete (peer-reviewd and approved by the PI) the series identifier can be added by updating the seriesId field of the system metadata of the metadata object. # The metadata identifier we&#39;re assigning an SID to metadata_pid &lt;- &#39;metadata_pid&#39; sys &lt;- getSystemMetadata(mn, metadata_pid) sys@seriesId &lt;- generateIdentifier(mn, scheme = &#39;DOI&#39;) #update the scheme argument if it should not be a DOI updateSystemMetadata(mn, metadata_pid, sys) Updating the child packages of a parent package with a SID When updating a parent package with a series identifier you need to use update_resource_map rather than publish_update.

We hope to add the following: [ADJUST THE DEPENDING ON WHAT IS MISSING] The motivation of the study Where and when the research took place At least one sentence summarizing general methodologies All acronyms are defined At least 100 words long Offer this if submitter is reluctant to change: If you prefer and it is appropriate, we could add language from the abstract in the NSF Award found here: [NSF AWARD URL]. Keywords We noticed that there were no keywords for this dataset. Adding keywords will help your dataset be discovered by others. Data Sensitive Data We will need to ask these questions manually until the fields are added to the webform. Data sensitivity categories Once we have the ontology this question can be asked: Based on our Data sensitivity categories, which of the 3 does your dataset align with most: Non-sensitive data - None of the data includes sensitive or protected information. Some or all data is sensitive with minimal risk - Sensitive data has been de-identified, anonymized, aggregated, or summarized to remove sensitivities and enable safe data distribution. Examples include ensuring that human subjects data, protected species data, archaeological site locations and personally identifiable information have been properly anonymized, aggregated and summarized. Some or all data is sensitive with significant risk - The data contains human subjects data or other sensitive data. Release of the data could cause harm or violate statutes, and must remain confidential following restrictions from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or similar body. Ethical research proceedures We were wondering if you could also address this question specifically on Ethical Research Procedures: Describe how and the extent to which data collection procedures followed community standards for ethical research practices (e.g., CARE Principles). Be explicit about Insitutional Review Board approvals, consent waivers, procedures for co-production, data sovreignty, and other issues addressing responsible and ethical research. Include any steps to anonymize, aggregate or de-identify the dataset, or to otherwise create a version for public distribution. We can help add your answers to the question to the metadata. Adding provenance Is the [mention the file names here] files related? If so we can add provenance to show the relationship between the files. Here is an example of how that is displayed: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi%3A10.18739%2FA2WS8HM6C#urn%3Auuid%3Af00c4d71-0242-4e9d-9745-8999776fa2f2 At least one data file We noticed that no data files were submitted. With the exception of sensitive social science data, we seek to include all data products prior to publication. We wanted to check if additional files will be submitted before we move forward with the submission process. Open formats Example using xlsx. Tailor this reponse to the format in question. We noticed that the submitted data files are in xlsx format. Please convert your files to a plain text/csv (or other open format); this helps ensure your data are usable in the long-term. The data files can be replaced by going to the green Edit button &gt; Click the black triangle by the Describe button for the data file &gt; Select Replace (attached is also a screenshot on how to get there). Zip files Except for very specific file types, we do not recommend that data are archived in zip format. Data that are zipped together can present a barrier to reuse since it is difficult to accurately document each file within the zip file in a machine readable way. File contents and relationships among files are clear Could you provide a short description of the files submitted? Information about how each file was generated (what software, source files, etc.) will help us create more robust metadata for long term use. Data layout Would you be able to clarify how the data in your files is laid out? Specifically, what do the rows and columns represent? We try not to prescribe a way the researchers must format their data as long as reasonable. However, in extreme cases (for example Excel spreadsheets with data and charts all in one sheet) we will want to kindly ask them to reformat. We would like to suggest a couple of modifications to the structure of your data. This will others to re-use it most effectively. [DESCRIBE WHAT MAY NEED TO BE CHANGED IN THE DATA SET]. Our data submission guidelines page (https://arcticdata.io/submit/) outlines what are best practices for data submissions to the Arctic Data Center. Let us know if you have any questions or if we can be of any help. Attributes Identify which attributes need additional information. If they are common attributes like date and time we do not need further clarification. Checklist for the datateam in reviewing attributes (NetCDF, CSV, shapefiles, or any other tabular datasets): A name (often the column or row header in the file). A complete definition. Any missing value codes along with explanations for those codes. For all numeric data, unit information is needed. For all date-time data, a date-time format is needed (e.g. “DD-MM-YYYY”). For text data, full descriptions for all patterns or code/definition pairs are needed if the text is constrained to a list of patterns or codes. Helpful templates: &gt; We would like your help in defining some of the attributes. Could you write a short description or units for the attributes listed? [Provide a the attribute names in list form] &gt; Could you describe ____? &gt; Please define “XYZ”, including the unit of measure. &gt; What are the units of measurement for the columns labeled “ABC” and “XYZ”? Missing value codes What do the missing values in your measurements represent? A short description of the reason why the values are missing (instrument failure, site not found, etc.) will suffice. This section is not yet available on our webform so we will add that information on your behalf. We noticed that the data files contain [blank cells - replace with missing values found]. What do these represent? Funding All NSF funded datasets need a funding number. Non-NSF funded datasets might not have funding numbers, depending on the funding organization. We noticed that your dataset does not appear to contain a funding number. The field accepts NSF funding numbers as well as other numbers by different organizations. Methods We noticed that methods were missing from the submission. Submissions should include the following: provide instrument names (if applicable) specify how sampling locations were chosen if citations for sampling methods are used, please provide a brief summary of the methods referenced any software used to process the data Note - this includes software submissions as well (see https://arcticdata.io/submit/#metadata-guidelines-for-software) Your methods section appears to be missing some information. [ADJUST THIS DEPENDING ON WHAT IS MISSING - Users should be able to understand how the data were collected, how to interpret the values, and potentially how to use the data in the case of specialized files.] Comprehensive methods information should be included directly in the metadata record. Pointers or URLs to other sites are unstable. A full example - New Submission: methods, excel to csv, and attributes Thank you for your recent submission to the NSF Arctic Data Center! From my preliminary examination of your submission I have noticed a few items that I would like to bring to your attention. We are here to help you publish your submission, but your continued assistance is needed to do so. See comments below: If there is a publication associated with this dataset, we would appreciate it if you could register the DOI of your published paper with us by using the Citations button right below the title at the dataset landing page. We are working to build our catalog of dataset citations in the Arctic Data Center. This can be added at any point. We would like to add some more context to your data package title. I would like to suggest: Holocene lake-based Arctic glacier and ice cap records. We noticed that the submitted data files are in xlsx format. Please convert your files to a plain text/csv (or other open format); this helps ensure your data are usable in the long-term. We also would like to suggest a couple of modifications to the structure of your data. This will others to re-use it most effectively. If the data was in a long rather than wide format, it would be easier to us to document. Our data submission guidelines page (https://arcticdata.io/submit/) outlines what are best practices for data submissions to the Arctic Data Center. Let us know if you have any questions or if we can be of any help. What do the missing values in your measurements represent? A short description of the reason why the values are missing (instrument failure, site not found, etc.) will suffice. We noticed that methods were missing from the submission. Submissions should: - provide instrument names (if applicable) - specify how sampling locations were chosen - provide citations for sampling methods that are not explained in detail - any software used to process the data After we receive your responses, we can make the edits on your behalf, or you are welcome to make them yourself using our user interface. Best, Name Final email templates Asking for approval Hi [submitter], I have updated your data package and you can view it here after logging in: [URL] Please review and approve it for publishing or let us know if you would like anything else changed. For your convenience, if we do not hear from you within a week we will proceed with publishing with a DOI. After publishing with a DOI, any further changes to the dataset will result in a new DOI. However, any previous DOIs will still resolve and point the user to the newest version. Please let us know if you have any questions. DOI and data package finalization comments Replying to questions about DOIs We attribute DOIs to data packages as one might give a DOI to a citable publication. Thus, a DOI is permanently associated with a unique and immutable version of a data package. If the data package changes, a new DOI will be created and the old DOI will be preserved with the original version. DOIs and URLs for previous versions of data packages remain active on the Arctic Data Center (will continue to resolve to the data package landing page for the specific version they are associated with), but a clear message will appear at the top of the page stating that “A newer version of this dataset exists” with a hyperlink to that latest version. With this approach, any past uses of a DOI (such as in a publication) will remain functional and will reference the specific version of the data package that was cited, while pointing users to the newest version if one exists. Clarification of updating with a DOI and version control We definitely support updating a data package that has already been assigned a DOI, but when we do so we mark it as a new revision that replaces the original and give it its own DOI. We do that so that any citations of the original version of the data package remain valid (i.e.: after the update, people still know exactly which data were used in the work citing it). Resolve the ticket Sending finalized URL and dataset citation before resolving ticket [NOTE: the URL format is very specific here, please try to follow it exactly (but substitute in the actual DOI of interest)] Here is the link and citation to your finalized data package: https://doi.org/10.18739/A20X0X First Last, et al. 2021. Title. Arctic Data Center. doi:10.18739/A20X0X. If in the future there is a publication associated with this dataset, we would appreciate it if you could register the DOI of your published paper with us by using the Citations button right below the title at the dataset landing page. We are working to build our catalog of dataset citations in the Arctic Data Center. Please let us know if you need any further assistance. Additional email templates Deadlines If the PI is checking about dates/timing: &gt; [give rough estimate of time it might take] &gt; Are you facing any deadlines? If so, we may be able to expedite publication of your submission. Pre-assigned DOI If the PI needs a DOI right away: We can provide you with a pre-assigned DOI that you can reference in your paper, as long as your submission is not facing a deadline from NSF for your final report. However, please note that it will not become active until after we have finished processing your submission and the package is published. Once you have your dataset published, we would appreciate it if you could register the DOI of your published paper with us by using the citations button beside the orange lock icon. We are working to build our catalog of dataset citations in the Arctic Data Center. Sensitive Data Which of the following categories best describes the level of sensitivity of your data? A. Non-sensitive data None of the data includes sensitive or protected information. Proceed with uploading data. B. Some or all data is sensitive but has been made safe for open distribution Sensitive data has been de-identified, anonymized, aggregated, or summarized to remove sensitivities and enable safe data distribution. Examples include ensuring that human subjects data, protected species data, archaeological site locations and personally identifiable information have been properly anonymized, aggregated and summarized. Proceed with uploading data, but ensure that only data that are safe for public distribution are uploaded. Address questions about anonymization, aggregation, de-identification, and data embargoes with the data curation support team before uploading data. Describe these approaches in the Methods section. C. Some or all data is sensitive and should not be distributed The data contains human subjects data or other sensitive data. Release of the data could cause harm or violate statutes, and must remain confidential following restrictions from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or similar body. Do NOT upload sensitive data. You should still upload a metadata description of your dataset that omits all sensitive information to inform the community of the dataset’s existence. Contact the data curation support team about possible alternative approaches to safely preserve sensitive or protected data. Ethical Research Procedures. Please describe how and the extent to which data collection procedures followed community standards for ethical research practices (e.g., CARE Principles). Be explicit about Institutional Review Board approvals, consent waivers, procedures for co-production, data sovereignty, and other issues addressing responsible and ethical research. Include any steps to anonymize, aggregate or de-identify the dataset, or to otherwise create a version for public distribution. Asking for dataset access As a security measure we ask that we get the approval from the original submitter of the dataset prior to granting edit permissions to all datasets. No response from the researcher Please email them before resolving a ticket like this: We are resolving this ticket for bookkeeping purposes, if you would like to follow up please feel free to respond to this email. Recovering Dataset submissions To recover dataset submissions that were not successful please do the following: Go to https://arcticdata.io/catalog/drafts Find your dataset and download the corresponding file Send us the file in an email Custom Search Link You could also use a permalink like this to direct users to the datasets: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/data/query=\"your search query here” for example: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/data/query=Beaufort%20Lagoon%20Ecosystems%20LTER Adding metadata via R KNB does not support direct uploading of EML metadata files through the website (we have a webform that creates metadata), but you can upload your data and metadata through R. Here are some training materials we have that use both the EML and datapack packages. It explains how to set your authentication token, build a package from metadata and data files, and publish the package to one of our test sites. I definitely recommend practicing on a test site prior to publishing to the production site your first time through. You can point to the KNB test node (dev.nceas.ucsb.edu) using this command: d1c &lt;- D1Client(\"STAGING2\", \"urn:node:mnTestKNB\") If you prefer, there are Java, Python, MATLAB, and Bash/cURL clients as well. Finding multiple data packages If linking to multiple data packages, you can send a link to the profile associated with the submitter’s ORCID iD and it will display all their data packages. e.g.: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/profile/http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2604-4533 NSF ARC data submission policy Please find an overview of our submission guidelines here: https://arcticdata.io/submit/, and NSF Office of Polar Programs policy information here: https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16055/nsf16055.jsp. Investigators should upload their data to the Arctic Data Center (https://arcticdata.io), or, where appropriate, to another community endorsed data archive that ensures the longevity, interpretation, public accessibility, and preservation of the data (e.g., GenBank, NCEI). Local and university web pages generally are not sufficient as an archive. Data preservation should be part of the institutional mission and data must remain accessible even if funding for the archive wanes (i.e., succession plans are in place). We would be happy to discuss the suitability of various archival locations with you further. In order to provide a central location for discovery of ARC-funded data, a metadata record must always be uploaded to the Arctic Data Center even when another community archive is used. Linking ORCiD and LDAP accounts First create an account at orcid.org/register if you have not already. After that account registration is complete, login to the KNB with your ORCID iD here: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#share. Next, hover over the icon on the top right and choose “My Profile”. Then, click the “Settings” tab and scroll down to “Add Another Account”. Enter your name or username from your Morpho account and select yourself (your name should populate as an option). Click the “+”. You will then need to log out of knb.ecoinformatics.org and then log back in with your old LDAP account (click “have an existing account”, and enter your Morpho credentials with the organization set to “unaffiliated”) to finalize the linkage between the two accounts. Navigate to “My Profile” and “Settings” to confirm the linkage. After completing this, all of your previously submitted data pacakges should show up on your KNB “My Profile” page, whether you are logged in using your ORCiD or Morpho account, and you will be able to submit data either using Morpho or our web interface. Or, try reversing my instructions - log in first using your Morpho account (by clicking the “existing account” button and selecting organization “unaffiliated”), look for your ORCiD account, then log out and back in with ORCiD to confirm the linkage. "],["pi-faq-email-templates.html", "PI FAQ email templates", " PI FAQ email templates Data Q: I would like to / have already uploaded data to ____ repository Review the repository, does it issue persistent identifiers (ie. DOIs)? Do they say how long they will be commiting to storing the data? If the answer is no to either questions, we will need to document and store any files in our own system. If any of this is unclear from what you can find online, you can message Matt to discuss with NSF if a particular repository will be allowed. Possible response for a generalist repository If your data doesn’t require features that only ____ provides, we would encourage you to consider publishing both the data and the metadata at the Arctic Data Center. Some benefits to submitting to us includes: We provide a DOI that can be cited in your published papers We track where datasets are being cited By submitting both the data and metadata to us, you can fulfill your NSF reporting requirements at the same time. This will reduce the work needed on your part to get any additional metadata requirements for NSF. Q: Can I replace data that have already been uploaded and keep the DOI? A: Once you have published your data with the Arctic Data Center, it can still be updated by providing an additional version which can replace the original, while still preserving the original and making it available to anyone who might have cited it. To update your data, return to the data submission tool used to submit it, and provide an update. Any update to a data package qualifies as a new version and therefore requires a new DOI. This is because each DOI represents a unique, immutable version, just like for a journal article. DOIs and URLs for previous versions of data packages remain active on the Arctic Data Center (will continue to resolve to the data package landing page for the specific version they are associated with), but a clear message will appear at the top of the page stating that “A newer version of this dataset exists” with a hyperlink to the latest version. With this approach, any past uses of a DOI (such as in a publication) will remain functional and will reference the specific version of the data package that was cited, while pointing users to the newest version if one exists. Datateam: please review this dataset again to make sure it follows current standards Q: Why don’t I see my data package on the ADC? Possible Answer #1: The data package is still private because we are processing it or awaiting your approval to publish it. Please login with your ORCID iD to view private data packages. Possible Answer #2: The data package is still private and you do not have access because you were not the submitter. If you need access please have the submitter send us a message from his/her email address confirming this, along with your ORCID iD. Once we receive that confirmation we will be happy to grant you permission to view and edit the data package. Possible Answer #3: The data package is still private and we accidentally failed to grant you access. We apologize for the mistake. We have since updated the access policy. Please let us know if you are still having trouble viewing the data package here: [URL]. Remember to login with your ORCID iD. Possible Answer #4: The URL was garbled by their email server (eg. URL Defense or the url was split into two lines). You can navigate to your dataset by going to your name in the top right and selecting my datasets. Issue: MANY files to upload (100s or 1000s) or large cumulative size. A: Datateam - Prior to accepting large uploads, take the time to make sure there is enough space available and uploading all the files is necessary. If it is not a NSF dataset see the section on Scope. We have a secure FTP you can access. Details are available here: https://help.nceas.ucsb.edu/remote_file_access . Please access our server at datateam.nceas.ucsb.edu with the username “visitor”. Let us know if you would like to use our SFTP and we will send you the password and the path to which directory to upload to. If you have files to transfer to us that total several terabytes it may be best to arrange a shipment of an external hard drive. Q: Can I add another data file to an existing submission without having to fill out another metadata form? A: Yes. Navigate to the data package after being sure to login. Then click the green “Edit” button. The form will populate with the already existing metadata so there is no need to fill it out again. Click “Add Files” and browse to the file you wish to add. Be aware that the DOI will change after you add this file (or make any changes to a data package) as, just like for a journal article, a DOI represents a unique and immutable version. The original URL and DOI will remain functional and valid, but clearly display a message at the top of that page stating that “A newer version of this dataset exists” with a link to the latest version. Only the newest version wil be discoverable via a search. We can also copy the metadata from existing dataset. Please send us the URL of the dataset you would like to copy and the title of the new dataset and we will be able to do that on your behalf. Q: I want to organize the order of the files/metadata entities A: We can reorganize entities within their entities. This is a limitation with our tools (EML). While re-ordering the groups of entities is possible manually, it isn’t possible the way write_eml and publish_update is written. We do not recommended reordering entities this way. Q: Can we submit data as an Excel file? A: While the Arctic Data Center supports the upload of any data file format, sharing data can be greatly enhanced if you use ubiquitous, easy-to-read formats. For instance, while Microsoft Excel files are commonplace, it is better to export these spreadsheets to Comma Separated Values (CSV) text files, which can be read on any computer without needing to have Microsoft products installed. So, yes, you are free to submit an Excel workbook, however we strongly recommend converting each sheet to a CSV. The goal is not only for users to be able to read data files, but to be able to analyze them with software, such as R Studio. Typically, we would extract any plots and include them as separate image files. [ONLY SAY THIS NEXT PART IF THE REQUESTOR CONTINUES TO INSIST and then USE PROV TO POINT FROM THE XLS TO THE CSVs] I understand that having the plots in the same file as the data they are built from simplifies organization. If you definitely prefer to have the Excel workbook included, we ask that you allow us to document the data in both formats and include a note in the metadata clarifying that the data are indeed duplicated (but in different formats). Q: Can we submit model output? A: Yes you can submit your model output to the Arctic Data Center. We also recommend including model source code directly in the dataset as it is critical to understand the model output dataset and will allow other researchers to re-produce your output. If the model is complex or it’s important to maintain file structure then it can submitted as a zip file. We also recommend included a detailed readme file that documents: version information, licensing information, a list of software/hardware used in development, a list of software/hardware dependencies needed to run the software, information detailing source data for models, any mathematical/physical explanations needed to understand models, any methods used to evaluate models, and instructions how to run the model if not including in the source code as comments. Please read our software submission guidelines for more detailed information: https://arcticdata.io/submit/#metadata-guidelines-for-software Access Q: May another person (e.g. my student) submit data using my ORCID iD so that it is linked to me? A: We recommend instead that the student set up their own ORCiD account at https://ORCiD.org/register and submit data packages from that account. Submissions are processed by our team and, at that point, we can grant you full rights to the metadata and data files even though another person submitted them. Issue: Web form not cooperating. A: To help us diagnose the problem, could you let us know the following: Which operating system (including the version) and browser (with version #) are you using? At which exact step did the issue arise? What error message did you receive? Do you have any reason to believe that you may be using a slow internet connection? Please provide us with any relevant screenshots and we will troubleshoot from there. Issue: Can’t log in to the Arctic Data Center A: Please accept our apologies that you are experiencing difficulty logging in. We suggest trying these troubleshooting steps: Try a different internet browser (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer etc.) Try clearing your cache and then re-logging in with orcid Id Privacy blockers (like EFF’s privacy badger https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) block the cookies needed for the login to work. To enable the cookies you need to disable your privacy tracker for arcticdata.io. If the problem persists please let us know what step the error occured or if there were error messages you have recieved. Scope Q: Can I submit a non-NSF funded dataset? Sample text 1: The Arctic Data Center is open to all arctic-related data. For larger data packages, we would likely need to charge a one-time archival fee which amortizes the long-term costs of preservation in a single payment. Please let us know the size of your dataset in terms of total number and total size of all files. We look forward to receiving your submission! Sample text 2: Yes, you can submit non-NSF-funded Arctic data if you are willing to submit under the licensing terms of the Arctic Data Center (CC-0 or CC-BY), the data are moderately sized (with exact limits open to discussion), and a lot of support time to curate the submission is not required (i.e., you submit a complete metadata record and well formatted, open format data files). For larger data packages, we would likely need to charge a one-time archival fee which amortizes the long-term costs of preservation in a single payment. Also, please note that NSF-funded projects take priority when it comes to processing. Information on best practices for data and metadata organization is available here: https://arcticdata.io/submit/#organizing-your-data. Q: Is ______ considered within the arctic We don’t have a precise geographic cutoff. We definitely will preserve any dataset that is funded by the Arctic section of the National Science Foundation, which includes many sub-Arctic studies. So, as long as the dataset is related to Arctic research defined broadly, we would consider it. We will prioritize NSF-funded projects because that is our main mandate, but we will also preserve non-NSF data about the Arctic as time allows. If you send more details about the study, its subject, location, and funding, we could be more definitive about whether we could archive it.

Solr allows you to quickly search through any coordinating or member node. Some more common use-cases include: Recovering lost PIDs - if you publish new data objects (publish_object) but forget to save the PIDs, you can recover them with a query. For example, you can search for all data objects that are not associated with a resource map and are published using your ORCiD (q=-resourceMap:*+AND+submitter:*XXXX-YYYY-ZZZZ-WWWW) Working with groups of packages - if you want to find all data, metadata, and resource maps associated with a PI, you can use their last name (q=origin:*SURNAME*) or perhaps their ORCiD (q=rightsHolder:*XXXX-YYYY-ZZZZ-WWWW) or both (q=origin:*SURNAME*+OR+rightsHolder:*XXXX-YYYY-ZZZZ-WWWW) to retrieve information about packages associated with them Once you understand the logic of queries, it becomes a flexible and useful tool that you can integrate into your R workflow. You can use queries to answer a variety of interesting questions, for example: What are the most recently updated data sets? What metadata and data objects are in a given data package? What is the total size (in terms of disk space) of all objects stored in Metacat? Querying Solr is possible by adding a query onto the end of a base URL or through the dataone::query() function in R. For now, we’ll just cover the basics of Solr queries in R. "],["construct-a-query.html", "Construct a query", " Construct a query Each Solr query is comprised of a number of parameters. These are like arguments to a function in R, but they are entered as parts of a URL. The most common parameters are: q: The query. This is like subset() or dplyr::filter() in R. fl: What fields are returned for the documents that match your query (q). If not set, all fields are returned. rows: The maximum number of documents to return. Solr will truncate your result if the result size is greater than rows. sort: Sorts the result by the values in the given Solr field (e.g., sort by date uploaded). The query (q) parameter uses a syntax that looks like field:value, where field is one of the Solr fields and value is an expression. The expression can match a specific value exactly, e.g., q=identifier:arctic-data.7747.1 or q=identifier:\"doi:10.5065/D60P0X4S\", which finds the Solr document for a specific Object by PID (identifier). In the second example, the DOI PID is surrounded in double quotes. This is because Solr has reserved characters, of which : is one, so we have to help Solr by surrounding values with reserved characters in them in quotes or by escaping them.

Well by default, all of those URLs above only return publicly-readable Solr documents. If a private document matches any of those queries, Solr won’t tell you that. It will act like the non-public-readable documents don’t exist. So we must pass an authentication token to access non-public-readable content.

In the above example, we have to do this to count only data objects. Without it, the facet result would include formatIds for metadata and resource maps, which we don’t want. Currently, the dataone::query() function does not support faceting, so you’ll have to run your queries as a URL. For additional ways to use faceting (such as pivot faceting), check out the Solr documentation. "],["use-stats.html", "Use stats", " Use stats With stats, we can have Solr calculate statistics on numerical values (such as size). https://arcticdata.io/metacat/d1/mn/v2/query/solr/?q=formatType:DATA&amp;stats=true&amp;stats.field=size&amp;rows=0 This query calculates a set of summary statistics for the size field on data objects that Solr has indexed. In this case, Solr’s size field indexes the size field in the system metadata for each object in Metacat.

When typing queries in R, it’s often easier to read if you use spaces. However, when using the browser, you may want to use + to keep the query clean. (The browser will replace spaces with %20.)

Resource maps provide information about the resources in the data package (i.e. which data files are associated with a particular metadata file (xml)). Before creating a new resource map, it is best to ensure that all the objects of interest have already been published to the node. Therefore, if you’ve only run publish_object() on the xml (in section 2.4 above), you will also need to publish all the data objects you wish to associate with the xml. The resource map you are about to create controls these linkages. Once all the objects that ought to belong to the package have been published, create a resource map using their respective PIDs (or the variables you saved the PIDs to) via the arcticdatautils::create_resource_map() function, like so: resource_map_pid &lt;- create_resource_map(adc_test, metadata_pid = metadata_pid, data_pids = data_pids) "],["get-package-and-eml.html", "Get package and EML", " Get package and EML Before we look more in depth at EML, we first need to load your data package into R.

This is a good generic name to use for EML documents. The generic name eml should not be used - as the EML package ships with an eml function, which can cause namespace issues in your environment if you have an object also called eml. Tip to always have the most recent resource map. When editing data packages, you always want to be working with the most recent update.

Here are some common uses for nesting: collected data vary by year an NSF award funds several related projects data collection is still ongoing data files exceed the 1000 file limit per data package "],["add-children-to-an-existing-parent.html", "Add children to an existing parent", " Add children to an existing parent A new package is published with a DOI and needs to be nested underneath a pre-existing parent. Nest the new child using the child_pids argument in publish_update(). resource_map_child_new &lt;- &quot;some_child_resource_map_pid&quot; pkg_parent &lt;- get_package(mn, &#39;resource_map_parent&#39;) publish_update(mn, resource_map_pid = pkg_parent$resource_map, metadata_pid = pkg_parent$metadata, data_pids = pkg_parent$data_pids, # parents usually don&#39;t contain data, but better to be safe child_pids = c(pkg_parent$child_packages, resource_map_child_new)) # include the resource map PIDs of ALL the childs* in the `child_pids` argument, otherwise the nesting relationships between any omitted childs and the parent will be deleted Check through all arguments carefully before you publish to production! Do you need to update the metadata? Does the parent include data objects? Does the parent have a parent? Parents can be tricky to fix and work with (especially if they have serial identifiers (SIDs)), so if you’re not sure how something works, try it on a test node. "],["create-a-new-parent-package.html", "Create a new parent package", " Create a new parent package In some cases, a parent package already exists. Search the ADC for the NSF award number to see if there are already exisiting packages. Parents usually have a UUID rather than a DOI and often start with a title like “Collaborative research:”, but not always. More typically, you will need to create a new parent by editing the existing metadata. The parent package should contain a generalized summary for the metadata of each of its childs. To create a new parent, you will need to: Create parent metadata. It’s often easiest to start with a child’s metadata and generalize them. Abstract/title: Remove dates and other details that are specific to the child package. Sometimes the NSF award abstract/ title will work. Data tables/other entities: Generally, top-level parents do not include data objects, so these sections can be removed. Geographic coverage: Expand to include geographic coverage of all childs, if needed. Temporal coverage: Expand to include temporal ranges of all childs, if needed. If the study is ongoing, include the most recent end date; the parent can be updated when additional childs are added. Methods: Often not needed, but may be included if all childs use the same methods. Publish the parent metadata to the member node (ADC) using publish_object(). Create a resource map to link the parent and childs together using create_resource_map() and the child_pids argument. Make sure you use the childs’ resource map PIDs when you create the resource map! If you forgot to do so, consult Jeanette for help fixing it. "],["example.html", "Example", " Example We can start by creating two data packages on the test node to nest beneath a parent. These data packages contain measurements taken from Lake E1 in Alaska in 2013 and 2014. First, load the Arctic Data Center Test Node and libraries. library(dataone) library(arcticdatautils) library(EML) cn_staging &lt;- CNode(&#39;STAGING&#39;) adc_test &lt;- getMNode(cn_staging,&#39;urn:node:mnTestARCTIC&#39;) cn &lt;- CNode(&#39;PROD&#39;) adc &lt;- getMNode(cn, &#39;urn:node:ARCTIC&#39;) We will re-create the following parent package: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/#view/urn:uuid:799b7a86-cb1c-497c-a05a-d73492915cad on the test node with two of its children. First we will copy two of the children to the test node, make sure your token for the test node is not expired. from &lt;- dataone::D1Client(&quot;PROD&quot;, &quot;urn:node:ARCTIC&quot;) to &lt;- dataone::D1Client(&quot;STAGING&quot;, &quot;urn:node:mnTestARCTIC&quot;) child_pkg_1 &lt;- datamgmt::clone_package(&#39;resource_map_doi:10.18739/A2KS1R&#39;, from = from, to = to, add_access_to = arcticdatautils:::get_token_subject(), change_auth_node = TRUE, new_pid = TRUE) child_pkg_2 &lt;- datamgmt::clone_package(&#39;resource_map_doi:10.18739/A2QK29&#39;, from = from, to = to, add_access_to = arcticdatautils:::get_token_subject(), change_auth_node = TRUE, new_pid = TRUE) These two packages correspond to data from the same study, varying only by year; however, they currently exist on the test node as independent entities. We will associate them with each other by nesting them underneath a parent. Now, let’s create a parent metadata file. Read in one of the childs’ metadata files (EML). We can download object from a node in binary format using dataone::getObject(). Once it’s downloaded we just need to convert to it to the proper format: in this case to EML format using EML::read_eml(). doc_parent &lt;- read_eml(getObject(adc_test, child_pkg_1$metadata)) ## View the title doc_parent$dataset$title The title of this child contains “2012-2013”. This is too specific for the parent, as the temporal range of both childs is 2012-2014. The parent should encompass this larger time range. doc_parent$dataset$title &lt;- &#39;Time series of water temperature, specific conductance, and oxygen from Lake E1, North Slope, Alaska, 2012-2014&#39; Like the title, the temporal coverage elements in this EML need to be adjusted. new_end_date &lt;- &quot;2014-09-20&quot; doc_parent$dataset$coverage$temporalCoverage$rangeOfDates$endDate$calendarDate &lt;- new_end_date Remove dataTables and otherEntitys from the metadata. If you recall from previous chapters, dataTables contain metadata associated with data files (generally CSVs) and otherEntitys contain metadata about any other files in the data package (for instance a README or coding script). Because the parent does not contain any data objects, we want to remove dataTables and otherEntitys from the metdata file. In this instance, the E1 2013 metadata only contain dataTables. We can remove these by setting the dataTable element in the EML to a new blank object. doc_parent$dataset$dataTable &lt;- NULL In this case, the abstract, contacts, creators, geographicDescription, and methods are already generalized and do not require changes. Before writing your parent EML make sure that it validates. This is just a check to make sure everything is in the correct format. eml_validate(doc_parent) After your EML validates we need to save, or “write”, it as a new file. Write your parent EML to a directory in your home folder. You can view this process like using “Save as” in Microsoft Word. We opened a file (“E1_2013.xml”), made some changes, and “saved it as” a new file called “doc_parent.xml”. # We can save the eml in a temporary file eml_path &lt;- file.path(tempdir(), &#39;science_metadata.xml&#39;) write_eml(doc_parent, path) Next, we will publish the parent metadata to the test node. metadata_parent &lt;- publish_object(adc_test, path = eml_path, format_id = format_eml()) Finally, we create a resource map for the parent package. We nest the two child data packages using the child_pids argument in create_resource_map(). Note that these child_pids are PIDs for the resource maps of the child packages, NOT the metadata PIDs. resource_map_parent &lt;- create_resource_map(adc_test, metadata_pid = metadata_parent, child_pids = c(child_pkg_1$resource_map, child_pkg_2$resource_map)) The child packages are now nested underneath the parent.
