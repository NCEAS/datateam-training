## Clean column names

You might have [read](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/0012-9623-90.2.205) that column names should not include spaces or special characters. Inevitably, you'll encounter data that are not so tidy. For example:

```{r echo = FALSE}
df <- data.frame(`First Name` = c("Homer", "Marge", "Ned"),
`Last Name` = c("Simpson", "Simpson", "Flanders"),
`date of birth` = c("1/1/1960", "10/20/1965", "3/22/1961"),
stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
check.names = FALSE)
print(df)
```

To tidy it up, you can use the `clean_names()` function from the `janitor` package:
    
```{r eval = FALSE}
janitor::clean_names(df)
```
