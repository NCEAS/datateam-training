## Fix Excel dates

Do you see something that looks like `43134, 43135, 43136` even though the column header is `Dates`? You may have encountered an **Excel date/time** problem. To fix it, the `janitor` package has a handy function:
    
```{r, eval = FALSE}
janitor::excel_numeric_to_date(c(43134, 43135, 43136))
```

```{block, type="warning"}
Make sure you check that the date makes sense!
```
