## Navigate through EML

The first task when editing an EML file is navigating the EML file. An EML file is organized in a structure that contains many lists nested within other lists. The function `View` allows you to get a crude view of an EML file in the viewer. It can be useful for exploring the file.

```{r echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE}
library(dataone)
library(EML)
```


```{r, error = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Need to be in this member node to explore file
d1c_test <- dataone::D1Client("STAGING", "urn:node:mnTestARCTIC")

doc <- read_eml(getObject(d1c_test@mn, "urn:uuid:558eabf1-1e91-4881-8ba3-ef8684d8f6a1"))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(doc)
```

The complex EML document is represented in R as as series of named, nested lists. We use lists all the time in R! A `data.frame` is one example of a special kind of list that we use all the time. You may be familiar with the syntax `dataframe$column_name` which allows us to select a particular column of a `data.frame`. Under the hood, a `data.frame` is a named list of vectors with the same length. You select one of those vectors using the `$` operator, which is called the "list selector operator." 

Just like you navigate in a `data.frame`, you can use the `$` operator to navigate through the EML structure. The `$` operator allows you to go deeper into the EML structure and to see what elements are nested within other elements. However, you have to tell R where you want to go in the structure when you use the `$` symbol. For example, if you want to view the dataset element of your EML you would use the command ```doc$dataset```. If you want to view the creators of your data set you would use ```doc$dataset$creator```. Note here that `creator` is contained within `dataset`. If you aren't sure where you want to go, hit the tab button on your keyboard after typing `$` and a list of available elements in the structure will appear (e.g., `doc$<TAB>`):

Note that if you hit tab, and nothing pops up, this most likely implies that you are trying to go into an EML element that can take a series items. For example ```doc$dataset$creator$<TAB>``` will not show a pop-up menu. This is because `creator` is a series-type object (i.e. you can have multiple `creator`s). If you want to go deeper into `creator`, you first must tell R which `creator` you are interested in. Do this by writing `[[i]]` first where `i` is the index of the `creator` you are concerned with. For example, if you want to look at the first `creator` i = 1. Now ```doc$dataset$creator[[1]]$<TAB>``` will give you many more options. Note, an empty autocomplete result sometimes means you have reached the end of a branch in the EML structure.

At this point stop and take a deep breath.  The key takeaway is that EML is a hierarchical tree structure.  The best way to get familiar with it is to explore the structure.  Try entering `doc$dataset` into your console, and print it. Now make the search more specific, for instance: `doc$dataset$abstract`.
