## Navigate through EML

The first task when editing an `eml` file is navigating the `eml` file. An `eml` file is organized in a structure that contains many lists nested within other lists. 
The function `EML::eml_view` (make sure to install the `listviewer` if you don't have it already) allows you to get a crude view of an `eml` file in the viewer. It can be useful for exploring the file.

```{r echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE}
library(dataone)
library(EML)

cn <- dataone::CNode('PROD')
mn <- dataone::getMNode(cn,'urn:node:ARCTIC')
```
```{r}
eml_raw <- rawToChar(dataone::getObject(mn,
                                        "doi:10.18739/A2FS1H"))
EML::eml_view(eml_raw) # you can also pass a path to an eml file
```

To navigate this complex structure in R, use the `@` symbol. The `@` symbol allows you to go deeper into the `eml` structure and to see what slots are nested within other slots. However, you have to tell R where you want to go in the structure when you use the `@` symbol. For example, if you want to go into the dataset of your `eml` you would use the command ```eml@dataset```. If you want to go to the creators of your data set you would use ```eml@dataset@creator```. Note here that `creators` are contained within `dataset`. If you aren't sure where you want to go, hit the tab button on your keyboard after typing `@` and a list of available locations in the structure will appear (e.g., `eml@<TAB>`):

Note if you hit tab, and the only option is `.Data`, this implies most likely that you are trying to go deeper within a list. For example ```eml@dataset@creator@<TAB>``` will return only `.Data`. This is because `creator` is a list object (i.e. you can have multiple creators). If you want to go deeper into `creator`, you first must tell R which creator you are interested in. Do this by writing `[[i]]` first where `i` is index of the creator you are concerned with. For example, if you want to look at the first creator i = 1. Now ```eml@dataset@creator[[1]]@<TAB>``` will give you many more options. Note, `.Data` also sometimes means you have reached the end of a branch in the `eml` structure.
