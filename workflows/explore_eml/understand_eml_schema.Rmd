## Understand the EML schema

Another great resource for navigating the EML structure is looking at the <a href = 'https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/schema/' target='_blank'>schema</a> which defines the structure. The schema diagrams on this page are interactive. Further explanations of the symbology can be found <a href = 'https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/22.0/ug-editor/topics/relax-ng-schema-diagram-symbols.html?hl=symbols' target='_blank'>here</a>. The schema is complicated and may take some time to get familiar with before you will be able to fully understand it. Use your browser's "search in page" function (usually CTRL-F or Command-F) to navigate the EML schema page quickly.

For example, let's take a look at <a href = 'https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/images/eml-party.png' target='_blank'>eml-party</a>. To start off, notice that some elements have bolded lines leading to them.

A bold line indicates that the element is _required_ if the element above it (to the left in the schema) is used, otherwise the element is _optional_.

Notice also that next to the `givenName` element it says "0..infinity". This means that the element is unbounded &mdash; a single party can have many given names and there is no limit on how many you can add. However, this text does not appear for the `surName` element &mdash; a party can have only one surname.

You will also see icons linking the EML slots together, which indicate the ordering of subsequent slots. These can indicate either a "sequence" or a "choice". In our example from `eml-party`, a "choice" icon indicates that either an `individualName`, `organizationName`, or `positionName` is required, but you do not need all three. However, the "sequence" icon tells us that if you use an `individualName`, you must include the `surName` as a child element. If you include the optional child elements `salutation` and `givenName`, they must be written in the order presented in the schema.

The eml schema sections you may find particularly helpful include <a href = 'https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/images/eml-party.png' target='_blank'>eml-party</a>, <a href = 'https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/images/eml-attribute.png' target='_blank'>eml-attribute</a> and <a href = 'https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/images/eml-physical.png' target='_blank'>eml-physical</a>.
