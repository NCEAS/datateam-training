We use the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) to store structured metadata for all datasets submitted to the Arctic Data Center. EML is written in XML (extensible markup language) and functions for building and editing EML are in the [EML R package](https://github.com/ropensci/EML).

For additional background on EML and principles for metadata creation, check out [this paper](data/eml-principles.pdf).

The first task when editing an `eml` file is navigating the `eml` file. An `eml` file is organized in a structure that contains many lists nested within other lists. 
The function `EML::eml_view` (make sure to install the `listviewer` if you don't have it already) allows you to get a crude view of an `eml` file in the viewer. It can be useful for exploring the file.

```{r echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE}
library(dataone)
library(arcticdatautils)
library(EML)

cn <- CNode('PROD')
mn <- getMNode(cn,'urn:node:ARCTIC')
```
```{r}
eml_raw <- rawToChar(dataone::getObject(mn,
                                        "doi:10.18739/A2FS1H"))
EML::eml_view(eml_raw) # you can also pass a path to an eml file
```

To navigate this complex structure in R, use the `@` symbol. The `@` symbol allows you to go deeper into the `eml` structure and to see what slots are nested within other slots. However, you have to tell R where you want to go in the structure when you use the `@` symbol. For example, if you want to go into the dataset of your `eml` you would use the command ```eml@dataset```. If you want to go to the creators of your data set you would use ```eml@dataset@creator```. Note here that `creators` are contained within `dataset`. If you aren't sure where you want to go, hit the tab button on your keyboard after typing `@` and a list of available locations in the structure will appear (e.g., `eml@<TAB>`):

Note if you hit tab, and the only option is `.Data`, this implies most likely that you are trying to go deeper within a list. For example ```eml@dataset@creator@<TAB>``` will return only `.Data`. This is because `creator` is a list object (i.e. you can have multiple creators). If you want to go deeper into `creator`, you first must tell R which creator you are interested in. Do this by writing `[[i]]` first where `i` is index of the creator you are concerned with. For example, if you want to look at the first creator i = 1. Now ```eml@dataset@creator[[1]]@<TAB>``` will give you many more options. Note, `.Data` also sometimes means you have reached the end of a branch in the `eml` structure.
