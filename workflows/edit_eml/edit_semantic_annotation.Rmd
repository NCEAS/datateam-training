## Semantic annotations

For a brief overview of what a semantic annotation is, and why we use them check out [this video.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Err-fL8O21kd1NzHJ9HJkK_B2fpt4sQW/view?usp=sharing)

Even more information on how to add semantic annotations to EML 2.2.0 can be found
 <a href = 'https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/semantic-annotation-primer.html'>here</a>. Currently metacatUI does not support the editing of semantic annotations on the website so all changes will have to be done in R.
 
There are several elements in the EML 2.2.0 schema that can be annotated:

* `dataset`
* entity (eg: `otherEntity` or `dataTable`)
* `attribute`

On the datateam, we will only be adding annotations to attributes for now.

### How annotations are used

This is a  <a href = 'https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi%3A10.18739%2FA2KW57J9Q'>dataset</a> that has semantic annotations included.

On the website you can see annotations in each of the attributes.

You can click on any one of them to search for more datasets with that same annotation.

#### Attribute-level annotations

To add annotations to the `attributeList` you will need information about the `propertyURI` and `valueURI`

Annotations are essentially composed of a sentence, which contains a subject (the attribute), predicate (`propertyURI`),
and object (`valueURI`). Because of the way our search interface is built, for now we will be using attribute annotations that have a `propertyURI` label of "contains measurements of type". 

Here is what an annotation for an attribute looks like in R. Note that both the `propertyURI` and `valueURI` have both a label, and the URI itself.

```{r eval=FALSE}
doc$dataset$dataTable[[i]]$attributeList$attribute[[i]]$annotation
```
```
$id
[1] "ODBcOyaTsg"

$propertyURI
$propertyURI$label
[1] "contains measurements of type"

$propertyURI$propertyURI
[1] "http://ecoinformatics.org/oboe/oboe.1.2/oboe-core.owl#containsMeasurementsOfType"


$valueURI
$valueURI$label
[1] "Distributed Biological Observatory region identifier"

$valueURI$valueURI
[1] "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002617"
```

### How to add an annotation

**1. Decide which variable to annotate**

The goal for the datateam is to start annotating every dataset that comes in. Practically, we cannot annotate
every single variable in every single dataset - this would take forever! Typically, there are a few key variables
that are measured in any particular dataset. These key variables are the ones we want to prioritize. Although having annotations on 
variables like date, longitude, or site name would be helpful, they shouldn't be our primary focus.


**2. Find an appropriate `valueURI`**

The next step is to find an appropriate value to fill in the blank of the sentence: "this attribute contains measurements of _____."

There are several ontologies to search in. In order of most to least likely to be relevant to the Arctic Data Center they are:

* [The Ecosystem Ontology (ECSO)](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ECSO/?p=classes&conceptid=http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002925)  
    - this was developed at NCEAS, and has many terms that are relevant to ecosystem processes, especially those involving carbon and nutrient cycling
* [The Environment Ontology (EnVO)](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ENVO/?p=classes&conceptid=root)
    - this is an ontology for the concise, controlled description of environments
* [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Organismal Classification (NCBITAXON)](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/NCBITAXON/?p=classes&conceptid=root)
    - The NCBI Taxonomy Database is a curated classification and nomenclature for all of the organisms in the public sequence databases.
* [Information Artifact Ontology (IAO)](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/IAO/?p=summary)
    - this ontology contains terms related to information entities (eg: journals, articles, datasets, identifiers)

To search, navigate through the "classes" until you find an appropriate term.

**3. Build the annotation in R**

We will have helper functions for this in the coming months, but for now it will be a bit of a manual process.

First you need to figure out the index of the attribute you want to annotate.

```{r, eval = F}
eml_get_simple(doc$dataset$dataTable[[3]]$attributeList, "attributeName")
```

```
 [1] "prdM"         "t090C"        "t190C"        "c0mS/cm"      "c1mS/cm"      "sal00"        "sal11"        "sbeox0V"      "flECO-AFL"
[10] "CStarTr0"     "cpar"         "v0"           "v4"           "v6"           "v7"           "svCM"         "altM"         "depSM"    
[19] "scan"         "sbeox0ML/L"   "sbeox0dOV/dT" "flag"    
```

Next, assign an `id` to the attribute. It should be unique within the document, and it's nice if it is human readable and related to the attribute it is describing.

```{r, eval = F}
doc$dataset$dataTable[[3]]$attributeList$attribute[[6]]$id <- "salinity_var"
```

Now, assign the `propertyURI` information. This will be the same for every annotation you build.

```{r, eval = F}
doc$dataset$dataTable[[3]]$attributeList$attribute[[6]]$annotation$propertyURI <- list(label = "contains measurements of type",
                                                                                       propertyURI = "http://ecoinformatics.org/oboe/oboe.1.2/oboe-core.owl#containsMeasurementsOfType")
```

Finally, add the `valueURI` information from your search. 

![](../images/bioportal_term.png)
You should see an ID on the Bioportal page that looks like a URL - this is the `valueURI`. Use the value to populate the label element.

```{r, eval = F}
doc$dataset$dataTable[[3]]$attributeList$attribute[[6]]$annotation$valueURI <- list(label = "Water Salinity",
                                                                                       valueURI = "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00001164")
```
