* Title
  + WHAT, WHERE, and WHEN:  
    - Is descriptive of the work (provides enough information to understand the contents at a general scientific level), AND includes temp
    - Provides a location of the work from the local to state or country level
    - Provides a time frame of the work
    - NO UNDEFINED ACRONYMS, ABBREVIATIONS, nor INITIALISMS unless approved of as being more widely-known in that form than spelled out
* Abstract
  + Describes the DATA as well as:
    - The motivation (purpose) of the study
    - Where and when the research took place
    - At least one sentence summarizing general methodologies
    - NO UNDEFINED ACRONYMS, ABBREVIATIONS, nor INITIALISMS unless approved of as being more widely-known in that form than spelled out
    - At least 100 words total
    - - tags such as  `<superscript>2</superscript>` and `<subscript>2</subscript>` can be used for nicer formatting
* Keywords
  + Some keywords are included
* Data
  + At least one data file, or an identifier to the files at another approved archive, unless funded by ASSP (Arctic Social Sciences Program)
  + No xls/xlsx files (or other proprietary files)
  + File contents and relationships among files are clear
  + Each file is well NAMEd and DESCRIBEd and clearly differentiated from all others
  + All attributes in EML match attribute names in respective data files EXACTLY, are clearly defined, have appropriate units, and are in the same order as in the file. <a href = 'https://nceas.github.io/datateam-training/reference/assess-attributes.html' target='_blank'>Quality control all `dimensionless` units</a>.
  + Missing value codes are explained (WHY are the data absent?)
* People & Parties
  + At least one contact and one creator with a name, email address, and ORCID iD
* Coverages
  + Includes coverages that make sense
    - Start date BEFORE end date
    - Spatial coverage matches geographic description (check hemispheres)
    - Geographic description is from the local to state or country level, at the least
    - Taxonomic coverage if appropriate
* Project Information
  + At least one FUNDING number
  + Title, personnel, and abstract match information from the AWARD (not from the data package)
* Methods
  + This section is REQUIRED for ALL NSF-FUNDED data packages
  + Enough detail is provided such that a reasonable scientist could interpret the study and data for reuse without needing to consult the researchers, nor any other resources
