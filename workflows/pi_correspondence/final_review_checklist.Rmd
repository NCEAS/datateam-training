- tags such as  `<superscript>2</superscript>` and `<subscript>2</subscript>` can be used for nicer formatting

### DataTable / OtherEntity / SpatialVectors
- in the correct one: **DataTable / OtherEntity / SpatialVector / SpatialRaster** for the file type
- **entityDescription** - longer than 5 words and unique
- **physical** present and format correct

#### Attribute Table
- complete
- attributeDefinitions longer than 3 words

### Check EML Version
- currently using: `eml-2.2.0` (as of July 30 2020)
- review to see if the EML version is set correctly by reviewing the ``doc$`@context` `` that it is indeed 2.2.0 under eml 
- Re-run your code again and have the line`emld::eml_version("eml-2.2.0")` at the top

### Access

  + make sure it is `http://` (no s)
