## Final Checklist

You can click on the `assessment report` on the website to for a general check. Fix anything you see there.

Send the link over slack for peer review by your fellow datateam members. Usually we look for the following (the list is not exhaustive):

### Special Datasets
Please refer to the dedicated pages for instructions to handle these cases:

- [MOSAiC](https://nceas.github.io/datateam-training/reference/MOSAiC.html)
- [DBO](https://nceas.github.io/datateam-training/reference/distributed-biological-observatory-dbo-submissions.html) 

### System Metadata
the format ids are correct

### General EML
Included lines for FAIR:
```{r eval=F}
doc <- eml_add_publisher(doc)
doc <- eml_add_entity_system(doc)
```
### Title
- No abbreviations, should include geographic and temporal coverage

### Abstract
- longer than 100 words
- no abbreviations or garbled text
- tags such as  `<superscript>2</superscript>` and `<subscript>2</subscript>` can be used for nicer formatting

### DataTable / OtherEntity / SpatialVectors
- in the correct one: **DataTable / OtherEntity / SpatialVector / SpatialRaster** for the file type
- **entityDescription** - longer than 5 words and unique
- **physical** present and format correct

#### Attribute Table
- complete
- attributeDefinitions longer than 3 words
- **Variables** match what is in the file
- **Measurement domain** - if appropirate (ie dateTime correct)
- **Missing Value Code** - accounted for if applicable
- **Semantic Annotation** - appropriate semantic annotations added, especially for spatial and temporal variables: lat, lon, date etc.

### People
- complete information for each person in each section
    + including ORCID and e-mail address for all contacts
    + people repeated across sections should have consistent information

### Geographic region
- the map looks correctand matches the geographic description
- check if negatives (-) are missing

### Project
- if it is an NSF award you can use the helper function:
    + `doc$dataset$project <- eml_nsf_to_project(awards)`
- for other awards that need to be set manually, see the [set project](https://nceas.github.io/datateam-training/reference/set-the-project-section.html) page

### Methods
- present
- no garbled text

### Check EML Version
- currently using: `eml-2.2.0` (as of July 30 2020)
- review to see if the EML version is set correctly by reviewing the ``doc$`@context` `` that it is indeed 2.2.0 under eml 
- Re-run your code again and have the line`emld::eml_version("eml-2.2.0")` at the top

### Access
- Granted access to PI using `set_rights_and_access()`
  + make sure it is `http://` (no s)
- **note** if it is a part of portals there might be specific access requirements for it to be visible using `set_access()`

### SFTP Files
- if there are files transferred to us via SFTP, delete those files when the ticket is resolved

### Updated datasets
All the above applies. These are some areas to do a closer check when users update with a new file:

- New data was added
  + Temporal Coverage and Title
  + and follow usual protocols
- Files were replaced
  + update physical and entityName
  + double-check attributes are the same
  + check for any new missing value codes that should be accounted for
- Was the dataset published before 2021?
  + update project info , annotations
- Glance over entire page for any small mistakes (ie. repeated additionalMetadata, any missed &amps, typos)
