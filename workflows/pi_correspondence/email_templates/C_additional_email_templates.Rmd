### Additional email templates

#### Deadlines
If the PI is checking about dates/timing:
> [give rough estimate of time it might take] 
> Are you facing any deadlines? If so, we may be able to expedite publication of your submission.

#### Pre-assigned DOI
If the PI needs a DOI right away:

> We can provide you with a pre-assigned DOI that you can reference in your paper, as long as your submission is not facing a deadline from NSF for your final report. However, please note that it will not become active until after we have finished processing your submission and the package is published. Once you have your dataset published, we would appreciate it if you could register the DOI of your published paper with us by using the citations button beside the orange lock icon. We are working to build our catalog of dataset citations in the Arctic Data Center.

#### Asking for dataset access
> As a security measure we ask that we get the approval from the original submitter of the dataset prior to granting edit permissions to all datasets. 

#### No response from the researcher
Please email them before resolving a ticket like this:

> We are resolving this ticket for bookkeeping purposes, if you would like to follow up please feel free to respond to this email.

#### Recovering Dataset submissions
> To recover dataset submissions that were not successful please do the following:

> 1. Go to https://arcticdata.io/catalog/drafts
2. Find your dataset and download the corresponding file
3. Send us the file in an email

#### Custom Search Link
> You could also use a permalink like this to direct users to the datasets:
https://arcticdata.io/catalog/data/query="your search query here"
for example: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/data/query=Beaufort%20Lagoon%20Ecosystems%20LTER

#### Adding metadata via R

> KNB does not support direct uploading of EML metadata files through the website (we have a webform that creates metadata), but you can upload your data and metadata through R.

><a href = 'http://training.arcticdata.io/materials/arctic-data-center-training/programming-metadata-and-data-publishing.html' target='_blank'>Here</a> are some training materials we have that use both the `EML` and `datapack` packages. It explains how to set your authentication token, build a package from metadata and data files, and publish the package to one of our test sites. I definitely recommend practicing on a test site prior to publishing to the production site your first time through. You can point to the KNB test node (dev.nceas.ucsb.edu) using this command: `d1c <- D1Client("STAGING2", "urn:node:mnTestKNB")`

> If you prefer, there are Java, Python, MATLAB, and Bash/cURL clients as well.

#### Finding multiple data packages

> If linking to multiple data packages, you can send a link to the profile associated with the submitter’s ORCID iD and it will display all their data packages.
	e.g.: <a href = 'https://arcticdata.io/catalog/profile/http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2604-4533' target='_blank'>https://arcticdata.io/catalog/profile/http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2604-4533</a> 
	
#### NSF ARC data submission policy

> Please find an overview of our submission guidelines here: <a href = 'https://arcticdata.io/submit/' target='_blank'>https://arcticdata.io/submit/</a>, and NSF Office of Polar Programs policy information here: <a href = 'https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16055/nsf16055.jsp' target='_blank'>https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16055/nsf16055.jsp</a>.

> Investigators should upload their data to the Arctic Data Center (<a href = 'https://arcticdata.io' target='_blank'>https://arcticdata.io</a>), or, where appropriate, to another community endorsed data archive that ensures the longevity, interpretation, public accessibility, and preservation of the data (e.g., GenBank, NCEI). Local and university web pages generally are not sufficient as an archive. Data preservation should be part of the institutional mission and data must remain accessible even if funding for the archive wanes (i.e., succession plans are in place). We would be happy to discuss the suitability of various archival locations with you further. In order to provide a central location for discovery of ARC-funded data, a metadata record must always be uploaded to the Arctic Data Center even when another community archive is used.

#### Linking ORCiD and LDAP accounts

> First create an account at orcid.org/register if you have not already. After that account registration is complete, login to the KNB with your ORCID iD here: <a href = 'https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#share' target='_blank'>https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#share</a>. Next, hover over the icon on the top right and choose "My Profile". Then, click the "Settings" tab and scroll down to "Add Another Account". Enter your name or username from your Morpho account and select yourself (your name should populate as an option). Click the "+". You will then need to log out of knb.ecoinformatics.org and then log back in with your old LDAP account (click "have an existing account", and enter your Morpho credentials with the organization set to "unaffiliated") to finalize the linkage between the two accounts. Navigate to "My Profile" and "Settings" to confirm the linkage.

> After completing this, all of your previously submitted data pacakges should show up on your KNB "My Profile" page, whether you are logged in using your ORCiD or Morpho account, and you will be able to submit data either using Morpho or our web interface.

> Or, try reversing my instructions - log in first using your Morpho account (by clicking the "existing account" button and selecting organization "unaffiliated"), look for your ORCiD account, then log out and back in with ORCiD to confirm the linkage.
