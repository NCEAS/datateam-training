### Comment templates based on what is missing

#### Portals

Multiple datasets under the same project - suggest data portal feature

> I would like to highlight the Data Portals feature that would enhance the ability of your datasets to be discovered together. It also enables some custom branding for the group or project. Here is an example page that we created for the Distributed Biological Observatory: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/portals/DBO. We highly suggest considering creating a portal for your datasets, you can get one started here: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/edit/portals/new/Settings. More information on how to set up can be found here: https://arcticdata.io/data-portals/.

If they ask to nest the dataset

> We are no longer supporting new nested datasets. We recommend to create a data portal instead. Portals will allow more control and has the same functionality as a nested dataset. You can get one started here: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/edit/portals/new/Settings. More information on how to set up can be found here: https://arcticdata.io/data-portals/, but as always we are here to help over email.

#### Dataset citations

> If there is a publication associated with this dataset, we would appreciate it if you could register the DOI of your published paper with us by using the Citations button right below the title at the dataset landing page. We are working to build our catalog of dataset citations in the Arctic Data Center.

#### Title

Provides the *what, where, and when* of the data

> We would like to add some more context to your data package title. I would like to suggest: ‘OUR SUGGESTION HERE, WHERE, WHEN’.

Does not use acronyms

> We wanted to clarify a couple of abbreviations. Could you help us in defining some of these: [LIST OF ACRONYMS TO DEFINE HERE]

#### Abstract

Describes DATA in package (ideally > 100 words)

> We would like to add some additional context to your abstract. We hope to add the following: [ADJUST THE DEPENDING ON WHAT IS MISSING]

    - The motivation of the study
    - Where and when the research took place
    - At least one sentence summarizing general methodologies
    - All acronyms are defined
    - At least 100 words long

Offer this if submitter is reluctant to change:

> If you prefer and it is appropriate, we could add language from the abstract in the NSF Award found here: [NSF AWARD URL].

#### Keywords

> We noticed that there were not keywords for this dataset. Adding keywords will help your dataset be discovered by others. 

#### Data

Sensitive Data

*Example response. Tailor this reponse to the format in question.*

> We wanted to check with you to make sure there is no sensitive data that could potentially be de-anonymized (eg. would there be small enough populations where the data could be disaggregated).

Adding provenance

> Is the [mention the file names here] files related? If so we can add provenance to show the relationship between the files. Here is an example of how that is displayed: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi%3A10.18739%2FA2WS8HM6C#urn%3Auuid%3Af00c4d71-0242-4e9d-9745-8999776fa2f2

At least one data file

> We noticed that no data files were submitted. With the exception of sensitive social science data, we seek to include all data products prior to publication. We wanted to check if additional files will be submitted before we move forward with the submission process.

Open formats

*Example using xlsx. Tailor this reponse to the format in question.*

> We noticed that the submitted data files are in xlsx format. Please convert your files to a plain text/csv (or other open format); this helps ensure your data are usable in the long-term.

Zip files

> Except for very specific file types, we do not recommend that data are archived in zip format. Data that are zipped together can present a barrier to reuse since it is difficult to accurately document each file within the zip file in a machine readable way.

File contents and relationships among files are clear

> Could you provide a short description of the files submitted? Information about how each file was generated (what software, source files, etc.) will help us create more robust metadata for long term use.

Data layout

> Would you be able to clarify how the data in your files is laid out? Specifically, what do the rows and columns represent?

We try not to prescribe a way the researchers must format their data as long as reasonable. However, in extreme cases (for example Excel spreadsheets with data and charts all in one sheet) we will want to kindly ask them to reformat.

> We would like to suggest a couple of modifications to the structure of your data. This will others to re-use it most effectively. [DESCRIBE WHAT MAY NEED TO BE CHANGED IN THE DATA SET]. Our data submission guidelines page (<a href = 'https://arcticdata.io/submit/' target='_blank'>https://arcticdata.io/submit/</a>) outlines what are best practices for data submissions to the Arctic Data Center. Let us know if you have any questions or if we can be of any help.

#### Attributes

Identify which attributes need additional information. If they are common attributes like date and time we do not need further clarification.

Checklist for the datateam in reviewing attributes (NetCDF, CSV, shapefiles, or any other tabular datasets):

- A name (often the column or row header in the file).
- A complete definition.
- Any missing value codes along with explanations for those codes.
- For all numeric data, unit information is needed.
- For all date-time data, a date-time format is needed (e.g. "DD-MM-YYYY").
- For text data, full descriptions for all patterns or code/definition pairs are needed if the text is constrained to a list of patterns or codes.

Helpful templates:
> We would like your help in defining some of the attributes. Could you write a short description or units for the attributes listed? [Provide a the attribute names in list form]
> Could you describe ____? 
> Please define “XYZ”, including the unit of measure. 
> What are the units of measurement for the columns labeled “ABC” and “XYZ”?

Missing value codes

> What do the missing values in your measurements represent? A short description of the reason why the values are missing (instrument failure, site not found, etc.) will suffice.

> We noticed that the data files contain [blank cells - replace with missing values found]. What do these represent? 

#### Funding

All NSF funded datasets need a funding number. Non-NSF funded datasets might not have funding numbers, depending on the funding organization.

> We noticed that your dataset does not appear to contain a funding number. The field accepts NSF funding numbers as well as other numbers by different organizations.

#### Methods

We noticed that methods were missing from the submission. Submissions should:

- provide instrument names (if applicable)
- specify how sampling locations were chosen
- provide citations for sampling methods that are not explained in detail
- any software used to process the data

*Note* - this includes software submissions as well (see <a href = 'https://arcticdata.io/submit/#metadata-guidelines-for-software' target='_blank'>https://arcticdata.io/submit/#metadata-guidelines-for-software</a>)

> Your methods section appears to be missing some information. [ADJUST THIS DEPENDING ON WHAT IS MISSING - Users should be able to understand how the data were collected, how to interpret the values, and potentially how to use the data in the case of specialized files.]

> Comprehensive methods information should be included directly in the metadata record. Pointers or URLs to other sites are unstable.

> We would like to add some more context to your data package title. I would like to suggest: Holocene lake-based Arctic glacier and ice cap records.
