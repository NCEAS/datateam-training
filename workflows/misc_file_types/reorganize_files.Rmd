## Reorganize files on the server

Useful commands to use when reorganizing large datasets to be prepped to be uploaded using `datapack`

```{block, type = "note"}
This is run in the terminal
```

### Basics

Moving around
```{bash, eval = F}
cd directory_name
```

Go up one directory using `..`
```{bash, eval = F}
cd ..
```

Get the contents of the current directory
```{bash, eval = F}
ls
```

Get the directory structure for this folder

- `-d` flag shows only the directories
```{bash, eval = F}
tree

tree -d
```

### Rename file based on file path
For example you have some files organized like this:
```
../../visitor/Lastname
└── RU_ALN_TR1_FL007R
│   └── rgb_images
|       └──image.png
└── RU_ALN_TR1_FL008B 
    └── micasense_preflight_calibration_images
        └──image.png
```

We want to rename the files.

1. Find all the files with the same file name
```{bash, eval = F}
find . -name 'image.png' 
```

2. First extract the file name in parts (`(.*)/(.*)/(.*)/(.*)`) by using the. `/` as a separator.

- Each part is represented by `$#`. If you want the last part of the file name:`$4`. Rearrange this section as needed:`$2/$3/$2-$3-$4`
- Set the flag as `-n` while testing to see the result of the renaming first before committing to it using `-v`
```{bash, eval = F}
rename -n -- 's|(.*)/(.*)/(.*)/(.*)$|$2/$3/$2-$3-$4|'

rename -v -- 's|(.*)/(.*)/(.*)/(.*)$|$2/$3/$2-$3-$4|'
```

3. Putting it together by taking the results from find and renaming those files

- `|` the pipe is like the `%>%` in R
```{bash, eval = F}
find . -name 'image.png' | rename -v -- 's|(.*)/(.*)/(.*)/(.*)$|$2/$3/$2-$3-$4|'
```

### Unzip files
```{bash, eval = F}
unzip '*zip'
```

### Zip shapefiles

1. For all the files in a directory, create a folder and move those files 
```{bash, eval = F}
for file in *; do dir=$(echo $file | cut -d. -f1); mkdir -p $dir; mv $file $dir; done
```

2. Zip the folders
```{bash, eval = F}
for file in *;do zip -r $file $file; done
```

3. Remove the directories after zipping

`-r` means to recursively remove files
```{bash, eval = F}
rm -r */
```
