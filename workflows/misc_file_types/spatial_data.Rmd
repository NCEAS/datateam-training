## Spatial data

Shapefiles and their associated files can be kept in a single grouping using *.zip (or another similar format). To extract metadata, simply run:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(sf)

pid <- "pid of a zipped shapefile on the ADC"

spatial_obj <- read_zip_shapefile(adc, pid)

st_geometry(spatial_obj)
```

This will return the shapefile as an `sf` style `data.frame` so that you can examine the attributes, and print the projection and geometry information. Note that the column `geometry` should not be considered an attribute for documentation purposes. This information is represented in the `spatialVector$geometry` element.
