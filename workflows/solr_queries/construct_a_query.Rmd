## Construct a query

Each Solr query is comprised of a number of parameters. These are like arguments to a function in R, but they are entered as parts of a URL.

The most common parameters are:

- `q`: The query. This is like `subset` or `dplyr::filter` in R
- `fl`: What fields are returned for the documents that match your query (`q`). If not set, all fields are returned.
- `rows`: The maximum number of documents to return. Solr will truncate your result if the result size is greater than `rows`.
- `sort`: Sorts the result by the values in the given Solr field (e.g., sort by date uploaded)

The query ('q') parameter uses a syntax that looks like `field:value`, where `field` is one of the Solr fields and `value` is an expression. The expression can match a specific value exactly, e.g., `q=identifier:arctic-data.7747.1` or `q=identifier:"doi:10.5065/D60P0X4S"`, which finds the Solr document for a specific Object by PID (identifier).


```{block, type = "note"}
In the second example, the DOI PID is surrounded in double quotes. This is because Solr has [reserved characters](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html), of which `:` is one, so we have to help Solr by surrounding values with reserved characters in them in quotes or escaping them.
```
